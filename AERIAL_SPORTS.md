# A small compendium of aerial sports

As an avid paragliding pilot, I am used to people being very confused on what exactly it is.

I have decided to compile this very small compendium of unpowered aerial sports to clear any confusion and set those notions straight.

(Most) of these unpowered sports have two very important basic concepts in common: the concept of **gliding** and the concept of **soaring**.

**Gliding** means using your height to cover a distance by trading vertical height for horizontal distance.

**Soaring** means using the natural air currents, especially parcels of rising air, to stay indefinitely airborne and gain height without using any means of powered propulsion.

The list goes in chronological order, from the oldest to the most modern one.

# Sailplane flying

A sailplane is a very small airplane that has no engine. It launches being towed behind a powered airplane and once it has reached a certain height, it is released. Modern sailplanes have remarkably good performance and can glide up to 60m-70m for every meter of height they have.

It is a moderate risk sport.

Its history is very closely related to the history of aviation.

It also has a (somewhat justified) reputation for being a very expensive sport for millionaires.

It requires a similar amount of training as a regular private pilot.

It is an established and widely recognized sport with a world federation and regular competitions.

Competitions usually revolve around flying far and fast using only the natural wind currents.

# Skydiving (parachuting)

A skydiver jumps from a plane and has two phases of flight - a free fall phase and a phase of descent with a deployed canopy.

**The typical parachute does not allow soaring and can not stay indefinitely in airborne.**

A skydiver carries two parachutes - a main canopy and a smaller reserve chute.

A recreational skydiver draws his excitement mostly from the free fall phase.

It is more of a recreational activity then a sport, but it is still recognized as a sport and it has a world federation and regular competitions.

It is somewhat easy to learn, requiring about 15 tandem jumps before being allowed a first solo jump.

Owing to its military history, it is a moderate risk activity with very rigorous safety regulations, that is very well documented and studied as it is always performed under strict supervision with a 1:200,000 jumps fatality rate.

Competitions usually revolve around aerobatics or landing precision.

# Hang-gliding (deltaplane)

A hang-glider is an ultra-light unpowered aircraft that it is launched on foot. Launching requires some height difference, *the initial capital*, after which a skilled pilot will be able to exploit its surroundings to continue to soar. Towed launches, usually being towed by a small powered aircraft, are also possible but are much less common.

A typical paraglider can glide about 12m to 15m for every meter of height.

It is a high risk sport with an annual fatality rate of regular flyers of about 1:1000.

It is also notorious for having a very steep learning curve - requiring lots of training before the first flight.

It is an established and widely recognized sport with a world federation and regular competitions.

Competitions usually revolve around flying far and fast using only the natural wind currents.

# Paragliding

A paraglider is a device that evolved from a ram-air parachute. Even if the canopy looks a lot like a parachute, the activity is much more closely related to hang-gliding than skydiving. A paragliding pilot does not jump and does not have a free fall phase - he launches akin to an aircraft - by gaining speed with his canopy already inflated. Just as the hang-glider, the paraglider requires some initial height. Towed launches, usually being towed by a cable from the ground, are also possible but are much less common.

Compared to a parachute, the paragliding canopy has much better gliding performance and a skilled pilot can soar and stay indefinitely airborne. That performance comes at the price of handling and safety - paragliding canopies are notorious for their spontaneous collapses in flight.

A typical paraglider can glide about 8m to 12m for every meter of height.

It is much more forgiving than a deltaplane for the beginner pilot. It requires about 1 week of ground training before being allowed a first solo flight.

It is a high risk sport with an annual fatality rate of regular flyers of about 1:1000.

It is an established and widely recognized sport with a world federation and regular competitions.

Most competitions usually revolve around flying far and fast using only the natural wind currents, but there is also precision landing and aerobatics owing to its shared history with skydiving.

# BASE jumping

BASE jumping is more or less skydiving from fixed objects, called exit points in BASE lingo, instead of an airplane - BASE stands for Building, Antenna, Span or Earth.

The canopy used is a device evolved from the backup chute of a skydiver. Unlike a skydiver, a base jumper carries a single parachute.
A base jumper draws his excitement from the very first few seconds of ultimate freedom - defying his death.

All aerial sports, heavily dependant on adrenaline, are known to cause some form of physical dependency, but the very short span and high intensity BASE jumping is notorious for causing a strong physical dependency akin to some recreational drugs.

**Once the canopy is deployed, just as in skydiving, the typical parachute does not allow soaring and can not stay indefinitely airborne.**

It is generally agreed that starting BASE jumping requires 50 previous airplane jumps.

It is more of a recreational activity then a sport.

There is no official governing body and no regular competitions.

It is (almost) always performed as illegal activity and there are few comprehensive studies on the fatality rates.

It is a very high risk activity.

# Wingsuit flying

Wingsuit flying can be performed both when skydiving or BASE jumping. It is an additional layer to both activities. A wingsuit flyer uses a special suit that inflates with the airspeed and allows him a certain degree of maneuverability and gliding capability before deploying its parachute.

A typical wingsuit can glide 3m to 4m per meter of height but its very high speed makes *soaring* impossible - very skilled pilots are able at best to slow down their fall.

The gliding speed does not permit a normal landing - the flight ends with a BASE jumping parachute. Just like the BASE jumper, a wingsuit flyer carries only a single parachute - which is illegal in the very tightly controlled world of skydiving.

It is more of a recreational activity then a sport.

It requires vast amounts of training and hundreds of skydiving and BASE jumps before the first flight.

There have been some attempts at creating a governing body and official aerobatics competitions, but the general situation is that wingsuit flying doesn't meet the safety criteria for official skydiving and it is (almost) always performed as an illegal activity.

It is a very high risk activity, especially in its most extreme form, the so-called proximity flying, and when performed with a BASE jump start.

There are few comprehensive studies on the fatality rates but according to some sources, annual rates as high as 1:60 have been cited for proximity flying with a BASE exit.
