# A small compendium of aerial sports

As an avid paragliding pilot, I am used to people being very confused on what exactly it is.

I have decided to compile this very small compendium of unpowered aerial sports to clear any confusion and set those notions straight.

(Most) of these unpowered sports have two very important basic concepts in common: the concept of **gliding** and the concept of **soaring**.

**Gliding** means using your height to cover a distance by trading vertical height for horizontal distance.

**Soaring** means using the natural air currents, especially parcels of rising air, to stay indefinitely airborne and gain height without using any means of powered propulsion.

The list goes in chronological order, from the oldest to the most modern one.

# Sailplane flying

A sailplane is a very small airplane that has no engine. It launches being towed behind a powered airplane and once it has reached a certain height, it is released. Modern sailplanes have remarkably good performance and can glide up to 60m for every meter of height they have - although 30m is more common for an average aircraft. The airspeed range is anywhere from 80km/h up to 250km/h. The current distance record for unpowered flight is 3,008km.

It is a high risk sport with an annual fatality rate of 1:800 (about 5 times the motorcycle fatality rate).

Its history is very closely related to the history of aviation.

It also has a (somewhat justified) reputation for being a very expensive sport for millionaires.

It requires a similar amount of training as a regular private pilot.

It is an established and widely recognized sport with a world federation and regular competitions.

It is quite popular with more than 100,000 pilots worldwide.

Competitions usually revolve around flying far and fast using only the natural wind currents.

# Skydiving (parachuting)

A skydiver jumps from a plane and has two phases of flight - a free fall phase and a phase of descent with a deployed canopy.

**The typical parachute does not allow soaring and can not stay indefinitely in airborne.** Once the canopy is deployed, the typical ram-air parachute can glide about 3m for every meter of height. A round parachute cannot glide.

A skydiver carries two parachutes - a main canopy and a smaller reserve chute.

A recreational skydiver draws his excitement mostly from the free fall phase.

It is more of a recreational activity then a sport, but it is still recognized as a sport and it has a world federation and regular competitions.

It is somewhat easy to learn, requiring about 15 tandem jumps before being allowed a first solo jump.

Owing to its military legacy, it is a moderate risk activity with very rigorous safety regulations, that is very well documented and studied as it is always performed under strict supervision with a 1:2000 annual fatality rate (twice the motorcycle fatality rate).

It is very popular, especially in the US. The total number of number skydivers in the world is estimated to over 400,000.

Competitions usually revolve around aerobatics or accuracy landing.

# Hang-gliding (deltaplane)

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Hang_gliding_hyner.jpg)

A hang-glider is an ultra-light unpowered aircraft that it is launched on foot. Launching requires some height difference, *the starting capital*, after which a skilled pilot will be able to exploit its surroundings to continue to soar. Towed launches, usually being towed by a small powered aircraft, are also possible but are much less common. A hang-glider can launch from a vertical cliff but the best launch spot is a very steep grassy slope.

A typical hang-glider can glide about 15m up to 20m for every meter of height. The airspeed range is from 40km/h up to 130km/h. The current distance record for unpowered flight is 764km.

Regulations in different countries vary a lot, but a hang-glider is generally considered to be an ultra-light aircraft and has to comply with VFR flight rules. Depending on the jurisdiction it may be required to possess a flight licence, civil aviation registration, special insurance or to pass regular technical inspections.

It is a high risk sport with an annual fatality rate of regular flyers of about 1:1000 (about 4 times the motorcycle fatality rate).

It is also notorious for having a very steep learning curve - requiring lots of training before the first flight.

It is an established and widely recognized sport with a world federation and regular competitions.

The popularity of hang-gliding has been steadily declining for the last few decades as more pilots switch to the easier and more practical form of gliding that is paragliding. The number of pilots in the world is estimated to be about 20,000.

Competitions usually revolve around flying far and fast using only the natural wind currents.

# Paragliding

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmomtchev/mmomtchev/master/G0053975.JPG)

A paraglider is a device that evolved from the ram-air parachute. Even if the canopy looks a lot like a parachute, the activity is much more closely related to hang-gliding than skydiving. A paragliding pilot does not jump and does not have a free fall phase - he launches akin to an aircraft - by gaining speed with his canopy already inflated. Just as the hang-glider, the paraglider requires some initial height. Towed launches, usually being towed by a cable from the ground, are also possible but are much less common. Just like its cousin the deltaplane, a paraglider can launch from a vertical cliff but the best launch spot is a very steep grassy slope.

Compared to a parachute, the paragliding canopy has much better gliding performance and a skilled pilot can soar and stay indefinitely airborne. That performance comes at the price of handling and safety - paragliding canopies are notorious for their spontaneous collapses in flight.

A typical paraglider can glide about 8m to 12m for every meter of height. The airspeed range is from 25km/h up to 60km/h. The current distance record for unpowered flight is 612km.

Regulations in different countries vary a lot, but a paraglider is generally considered to be an ultra-light aircraft and has to comply with VFR flight rules. Depending on the jurisdiction it may be required to possess a flight licence, civil aviation registration, special insurance or to pass regular technical inspections.

It is much more forgiving than a deltaplane for the beginner pilot. It requires about 1 week of ground training before being allowed a first solo flight.

It is a high risk sport with an annual fatality rate of regular flyers of about 1:1000 (about 4 times the motorcycle fatality rate).

It is an established and widely recognized sport with a world federation and regular competitions.

It is a sport that has seen dramatic growth over the last few decades as it is much cheaper than other aerial gliding sports, it is much easier on the beginner pilot and all the gear fits in a large backpack that can easily be carried on foot - unlike sailplane flying and hang-gliding which require costly infrastructure. The sport is very popular in Europe with about 80% of the world's pilots being in France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy and Spain with France and Germany alone accounting for about half of the world pilots. The total number of pilots in the world is estimated to about 150,000.

Most competitions usually revolve around flying far and fast using only the natural wind currents, but there is also accuracy landing and aerobatics owing to its shared history with skydiving.

# BASE jumping

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/04KJER0243.jpg)

BASE jumping is more or less skydiving from fixed objects, called exit points in BASE lingo, instead of an airplane - BASE stands for Building, Antenna, Span or Earth. When launching from a cliff, the cliff must be almost vertical as the free-falling jumper cannot glide.

The canopy used is a device evolved from the backup chute of a skydiver. Unlike a skydiver, a base jumper carries a single parachute.

A base jumper draws his excitement from the very first few seconds of ultimate freedom - defying his death.

All aerial sports, heavily dependant on adrenaline, are known to cause some form of physical dependency, but the very short span and high intensity BASE jumping is notorious for causing a strong physical dependency akin to some recreational drugs.

**Once the canopy is deployed, just as in skydiving, the typical parachute does not allow soaring and can not stay indefinitely airborne.**

It is generally agreed that starting BASE jumping requires at least 50 previous jumps from an airplane.

It is more of a recreational activity then a sport.

There is no official governing body and no regular competitions.

It is (almost) always performed as illegal activity and there are few comprehensive studies on the fatality rates. The legal status of an airborne pilot is not very clear.

Even if the activity has seen dramatic growth over the last decade, the very high risks involved limit the number of active practitioners. It is estimated that there are about 2,000 active jumpers in the world.

It is a very high risk activity and the fatality rates tend to be sketchy, an annual fatality rate of 1:500 is often cited (8 times the motorcycle fatality rate).

# Wingsuit flying

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Wingsuit_Flying_over_Langar_Airfield_UK.jpg)

Wingsuit flying can be performed both when skydiving or BASE jumping. It is an additional layer to both activities. A wingsuit flyer uses a special suit that inflates with the airspeed and allows him a certain degree of maneuverability and gliding capability before deploying its parachute.

A typical wingsuit can glide 3m to 4m per meter of height but its very high speed makes *soaring* impossible - very skilled pilots are able at best to slow down their fall. The airspeed range is from 150km/h up to more than 300km/h.

The gliding speed does not permit a normal landing - the flight ends with a BASE jumping parachute. Just like the BASE jumper, a wingsuit flyer carries only a single parachute - which is illegal in the very tightly controlled world of skydiving. There have been cases of aircraft pilots having their flying licenses revoked for allowing wingsuit jumping out of the planes they were piloting.

It is more of a recreational activity then a sport.

It requires vast amounts of training and hundreds of skydiving and BASE jumps before the first flight.

There have been some attempts at creating a governing body and official aerobatics competitions, but the general situation is that wingsuit flying doesn't meet the safety criteria for official skydiving and it is (almost) always performed as an illegal activity. The legal status of an airborne pilot is not very clear.

It is an outrageously dangerous activity, especially in its most extreme form, the so-called proximity flying, and when performed with a BASE jump start. There probably just a few hundreds experienced pilots in the world.

There are few comprehensive studies on the fatality rates but according to some sources, annual rates as high as 1:60 have been cited for proximity flying with a BASE exit - this is 70 times the motorcycle fatality rate.

# Speed Flying

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/Speedflying.jpg)

Speed flying is a higher speed version of paragliding that uses a smaller, faster and more agile canopy. Launching is performed in the same way as a paraglider - by inflating on the ground and then gaining speed. **The much higher speed does not allow for soaring** - allowing for much shorter but more intense experience.

It usually requires previous paragliding experience - as the canopy is much less forgiving of beginners errors.

A typical canopy allows gliding about 5m to 6m for every meter of height. The airspeed range is from 50km/h up to 120km/h.

It is more of a recreational activity then a sport.

There is no official governing body and no regular competitions - but there might be one day.

It is legal in most countries - under the same rules as paragliding.

Also, the limit between speed flying and paragliding has become somewhat blurred during the last decade with the appearance of various wings whose size, speed and agility are filling the gap between the two sports. The general rule of thumb is that if the wing allows soaring - it is paragliding, and if the only flight possible is straight down - it is speed flying.

Just as paragliding its popularity has seen dramatic growth in the last decade, it is estimated that about 1 in 4 paragliding pilots owns also a speed flying wing.

It is a very high risk activity for which very few statistics are available.

# Speed Riding

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Francois_Bon.jpg)

Speed riding is a cross-over sport between speed flying and skiing.

It requires both good speed flying and skiing skills.

It is more of a recreational activity then a sport - but it definitely has the potential to become a real sport.

It still has no official governing body and no regular competitions.

It is legal in most countries - usually under the same rules as paragliding - but many ski resorts ban it because of the risks involved.

The risk factor varies from just above skiing if performed on a regular ski slope to outrageously dangerous if performed for jumping across cliffs.
