For newcomers to wonderland, the section below details my adventures as a homeless person in France at the center of an extortion involving the French judiciary, police and the largest IT companies in the world.

I am also sharing with you one of my 1€ meal recipes - before I was evicted from my home in October 2024, I spent 4 years living on social welfare. I was evicted in order to force me to accept a job at [Discngine](https://www.discngine.com/) without speaking about the affair - as they were willing to continue playing this game given that I am blocked from suing anyone. [Welcome To the Jungle](https://welcometothejungle.com/) is the recruitment company where these deals are considered business as usual.

# Latest Updates (the *Vincent van Gogh extortion*)

> Vincent van Gogh's style is characterized by bold, dramatic brush strokes, vibrant colors, and a sense of movement, often achieved through impasto techniques where paint is applied thickly. His work reflects emotional intensity and personal experiences, making him a key figure in the Post-Impressionist movement.

 * Oct 8: Today I moved a little bit closer to a good Wi-Fi to update my Android apps and download some software - I got a relatively fast (about 1 hour) acknowledgment as a push notification from the N26 bank. My OpenVPN server at Scaleway is very closely monitored so it is possible to know what regular IP apps I am currently using - without identifying my physical location. This is why I stopped pinging `8.8.8.8` to determine my Wi-Fi quality - to stop Google from cross-checking the pings from inside the tunnel with the pings from the Wi-Fi.

 * Oct 4: The goatse stream is back - this time as reddit posts and Spotify recommendations. reddit seems to be focused on human anatomy, while the Spotify recommendations feature podcasts about smoking crack cocaine and the September 11 terrorist attacks. This is not a new theme, it usually pops out every time the police is involved. 2 years ago when an armed squad with draw guns came to my home they tried to use the *conspiracy* code word. When I could not stop laughing, they decided to simply leave without arresting and without searching my home. Then I got a number of simultaneous notifications in all the open-source projects that I was working on on Github. When I refused to shut up, the Node.js team blocked me from posting in their projects.

 *(I should probably include the [absolutely remarkable exchange](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmomtchev/mmomtchev/refs/heads/master/dexcelerate.png) with this company called Dexcelerate, which will be one of the most memorable moments of the whole affair)*

 * Sep 24: Shortly after posting about the police seizing my car, I was contacted by a rather amusing company called [Dexcelerate](https://www.dexcelerate.com) who offered me a job because "they had seen my work at Github and were interested by my experience". I asked them if they were interested in my experience with extortion by the police or they already had such experience, after which they told me that they owned all the banks and the media so I could not do anything but accept their offer. At this point I kindly reminded them that all their bases were belong to me.
 (*It seems that the powers to be have decided that three most important things in this world are - in this order - bread, circuses and Biggus Dickus' manhood*)

 * Sep 24: I have received my new 5db amplified Wi-Fi antennas and now I can have Internet access virtually everywhere (remember to check my guide). I was almost sure that Amazon had prepared some dirty trick and I did record a video of the opening of the locker, but this time everything was there.

 * Sep 15: In a new attempt to push me up against the wall, the police have seized my old E46 Bimmer from a public parking under the pretext that it was not insured. Although it was a BMW classic, it was far too old to justify doing anything - especially considering the scale of the affair. They knew its location thanks to cooperation from Waze, Google and my telecom operator - Free.

 * Sep 15: I have switched to full stealth mode now and I avoid using my mobile phone at all. I am currently mostly wardriving for public Wi-Fi APs as well as writing a [guide](https://github.com/mmomtchev/Urban-Tech-Guerilla.git).

 * Sep 14: I am back to the Paris suburbs after spending the last few months mingling with the paragliding pilots in the Alps. The trip was largely uneventful not counting a number of times that I was asked the same question about my weather side that people usually ask me simultaneously (this a behavior that I still haven't been able to decode, but I am sure that there must be some kind of Biggus Logicus behind it). Officially, most people do not know me.

 * Aug 1: Today I used my highway badge from [BipAndGo](https://www.bipandgo.com/en/) for the first time in the last 2 years to pay for a mountain tunnel and a few hours later I got a handcrafted phishing spam telling me that my payment was refused.

 * Jul 28: For the last few days the goatse push notifications from X have been replaced by very large numbers of seemingly random push notifications, many of them mentioning the Bun project - without any of them satisfying my requirement of implicating them directly - and what appears to be an account posting mostly about the war in Ukraine called [MAKS 25](https://x.com/Maks_NAFO_FELLA). 5 years ago, at the start of the 3rd season of this affair, I doubled my claim from 200K€ to 400K€ after my lawyer secretly cancelled the ongoing suit against my former employer. At this point the security personnel of my former apartment left a cardboard with 50,000 written on it, so I guess that this must be an attempt of trying to halve that offer.

 * Jul 24: A few days ago, simultaneously with the Microsoft block, I got my first job offer from the French state unemployment office. The last one I got was 6 months ago from the Parisian subway metro system when I publicly announced that my pass was used to track my movements. I replied, then this morning I got another one, with lower pay for a Python developer. When the extortion first started in 2020, I was always getting simultaneous job offers - one matching my skill set with a penis or viagra posted somewhere and another one for a Python developer. These are the two companies involved this time:
   - [E-Kent](https://www.e-kent.fr/)
   - [Ikos Consulting](https://www.ikosconsulting.com/en/)

 * Jul 22: Microsoft decided to block the weather alerts from my weather site to `@outlook.com` addresses. They had already blocked alerts to `@outlook.it`, but as the number of users from Italy is very limited, this didn't have any effect. I got some simultaneous phone calls and likes on very old X posts linked to the extortion in order to show that it was a deliberate act.

 * Jul 18: The goatse push notifications from X seem to have resumed during the last few days. The new twist is that they feature heavily the Bun X account. All this makes me consider implementing the missing Node-API / libuv features in Bun and then submitting a PR with a note explaining that this PR cannot be merged because it is missing an authorization by *HRM Capo di Tutti Capi* as it interferes with his policy of being the *Biggus of all 'em Dickus*. As this currently would be somewhat unethical towards Bun, I will need more convincing proof that Bun has indeed something to do with this.

 * Jul 8: This morning there was a very elaborate scheme involving X notifications, anatomical parts and the [Bun](https://x.com/bunjavascript) X account, after I checked out some of the [`bun`](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun) code from Github.

 * Jun 23: After replacing my leaking faucet in my camper van at Narbonne Accessoires, a French chain specialized in camper vans, they also sent me their catalogue at my Salvation Army PO box - an address they did not have - in order to show me that they were providing my personal data for this extortion.

 * Jun 22: Now I am getting notifications from Google about unauthorized access to my Google Photos which are obviously coming from Google themselves. Google, when I am finished with you, your new motto will be *"We did evil, but now we repent"*, you will be doing charity work on Sundays and you will have *"Size does not matter"* bumper stickers.

 * Jun 11-13: I was at JSNation 2025 in Amsterdam. It was a huge success - unlike the previous two conferences where the organizers tried to ignore me - this time I was thrown out of the conference grounds - meaning that I gained not one, but two ranks at once on the Mahatma Gandhi scale. I was able to hand out my whole 500-pack of leaflets and people were generally very positive. Just as expected, here it was not possible to track me using my mobile phone as the local operators are not cooperating for now. 

 * May 31: This evening I had my mobile phone switched off but my van was parked at a spot where I usually go to stay online and a guy carrying a screwdriver opened the door while I was inside to tell me that he had come to steal, then hastily walked away. I hadn't used my mobile phone today at this spot - this means that when my mobile phone is switched off, someone is scouting the places where I have been seen previously.

 * May 21: Half an hour after the previous update about the new theme, I got a new theme notification from my fuel efficiency tracking mobile app.

 * May 21: Since this morning, the focus seems to have shifted from the purely anatomical elements to more generic romantic subjects. I am getting dating spam (yes, it is a new invention) on Telegram as well as *I am missing you* notifications with broken hears from mobile games that I play on my smartphone.

 * May 16: Today I got a simultaneous SMS from the French equivalent of IRS with one of those phone calls. The phone call came right before the SMS inviting me to fill my declaration - which I get each year around the same date - to demonstrate the insider knowledge.

 * May 15: The only refreshing news is that for the last few days the X goatse stream seems to have switched its focus from male genitalia to female mammary glands.

 * May 14: This morning I received two simultaneous mails - from [Pulsetic](https://app.pulsetic.com/monitors), the service monitoring my websites - velivole.fr, XC-DB, SCodex and a few others - as well as an offer to monitor my opensource projects from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. For the past few weeks some of the locations in Pulsetic have been generating false positive checks, so I guess that this is related. Before Pulsetic, I was using [https://uptimerobot.com](https://uptimerobot.com) but they disconnected my service simultaneously with the criminal eviction from my home to serve as intimidation - in order to accept the job offer by [Discngine](https://www.discngine.com) who were willing take part in the goatse game.

 * May 13: I am still getting more of the phishing SMSs that I was getting in 2024 simultaneous with the French public administration, insurance companies, banks and etc. intermixed with SMSs of the *wrong number* type. I am still wondering if the goal is to genuinely convince me that these were in fact random, or to simply extort me to accept this fact. However I am starting to see the brilliance of this approach and I have decided to adopt a similar posture. From now on, I will be publishing blank lines in between the narrative - giving everyone the option to either see only the text - or only the blank lines - so that he can affirm that I am not saying anything. I will probably be making long pauses when I explain this in person.

 * (*this line intentionally left blank*)

 * May 8: The goatse notifications have now been largely replaced by subliminal messages in reddit notifications from French-language subs that I do not follow - such as this [one](https://x.com/mmomtchev/status/1920548812843524594). Also, I usually get series of phone calls over few days - I have been getting them for the last 5 years - and usually the last ones come from various exotic destinations - this time it was Kenya and Croatia. The only new twist was that that at the end of the series, I got a simultaneous phone call - and an SMS message from a different number - which something along the lines of *Lisa, what are you doing this afternoon*. Despite all my experience with the psychiatric condition of the main protagonist, I am still trying to decipher its meaning - making it look as if all of these were cases of a wrong number? Extorting me to accept this version? Very difficult to say.

 * Apr 30: I got only one of the goatse notifications this morning - I was not able to check if this time it was a normal notification or if it was still a notification with a prescheduled presentation time (the ad type), however simultaneously with it, I also got a real Reddit notification from a French-language sub that I do not follow - I do not follow any French-language subs in fact - which is definitely related to the psychiatric condition of the person doing this: [Interesting](https://www.reddit.com/r/discussionsbancales/comments/1kaquej/interesting/). Maybe he wants to acknowledge his psychiatric condition? Difficult to say.

 * Apr 29: Notifications from N26 and LIDL have stopped, but the X ones are still ongoing - even if the focus seems to have shifted from unusual sexual practices to illegal drugs. As I have some passing knowledge of the Google Android platform, I have noticed that these are not push notifications like the normal X notifications - these are pre-scheduled notifications that are likely sent through the Google Firebase Cloud Platform - and made to appear as normal notifications. This circuit is often used for advertising messages. It is not clear if they are really sent by X, or simply by someone at Google who has access to the FCM infrastructure.

 * Apr 13-24: I have been getting multiple identical notifications on my mobile phone from N26, X and LIDL - companies that have made it clear that they are providing my personal information for this extortion - for the last two weeks. It is not clear if they are doing - or if Google is doing it - since the notifications do not appear in the applications' logs. Some of X's notifications mention masturbation and orgasms.

 * Apr 11: Once again, I got my welfare suspended without any warning - I simply did not get the money at the beginning of the month. After checking, the official explanation was that once again I had forgot to fill the declaration - this is the third time this happens - after the first one I had sued the French administration, then I got a simultaneous message from the investigating judge with the second suspension as a warning. This time I had kept a copy of the declaration and the French administration admitted that it must have been some kind of a mistake.

 * Apr 4: The police office in charge of my request for a new driving license tried convincing me that as a homeless person, I could not get it - I insisted that my PO box address at the Salvation Army was sufficient and they finally agreed.

 * Mar 28: DPD seem to have lost my parcel containing the flyers for React Native Connection 2025. They initially claimed that it was delivered, but the Salvation Army collect point that was the destination was closed on that day. Today I got a number of simultaneous tweets including one from DPD. I guess I am going to use leftover flyers from the last conference - I still have a full pack of them. In France, DPD is very close to the French national post office - which has been very heavily involved in this affair.

 * Mar 24: I am going guerilla style to the React Native Connection 2025 in Paris and I had ordered a pack of flyers and I just got a phishing SMS from a private phone number in France that says that my package does not fit in my mailbox. It is not clear if it is the printing house - pixartprinting.com - or DPD - the parcel shipping.

 * Mar 13: Today the server hosting my mails, my paragliding weather site, the Star Citizen fansite and some of my work was again the target of a DDoS attack involving some 4000 IP addresses all belonging to a telecom operator in Singapore called called Aceville. The Tier-1 operator was Tencent - the big Chinese telecom operator.  What was truly remarkable is that many of the IP addresses were unallocated in the RIPE database but were still routable by Tencent - which might be indicative of someone at Tencent being involved. Aceville is owned by Tencent and they are not newcomers when it comes to controversy. Simultaneously with this attack, I was contacted by a newly created account on X who claimed to have found my wallet. I told him to go deposit at the nearest police station, as there has been a few attempts to draw money from my card and all my identity papers were already declared as having been stolen. 

 * Mar 8: It has been almost a full month without anything outrageously criminal happening until yesterday. As the weather in France has improved, I spent more than 48h in my campervan working with my mobile phone constantly online. I was alone on an abandoned parking when shortly after midnight two vehicles came after midnight and spent half an hour with their headlights on me. The next day there was one scantily clad female who did wander around the van for awhile. Then finally, while charging at a charging station, my wallet - with all my identity papers and bank cards - disappeared. I spent a few minutes at the back of the van while fiddling with the cables and someone was probably able to fetch it at this very moment. Today, the next day, someone tried to use my N26 card and I got simultaneously one of those phishing SMSs that I have been regularly getting at each *event*. We will see how will the police react to this complaint in the current situation. I will probably be reducing dramatically the time I spend online. I am considering a solution with a burner phone and some kind of onion relay since both Github and Scaleway - where my mail server is hosted - are monitoring my traffic.

 * Feb 9: Suddenly, I started getting approvals for some of my older PRs dating back to 2022/2023. Yeah, because, you know, maybe, after a series of events definitely enough to warrant a competency evaluation by a forensic psychiatrist, 3 years of extortion, living on welfare, and then one winter on the street, you know, maybe, we could live happily ever after?

 * Feb 2: As I cannot afford to pay the insurance for my E46 Bimmer, I decided to scrap it. The insurance company - the same one that posted simultaneously with people in Google WASM projects to intimidate me to stop discussing their fraud case - tried to contact me and I also got a phishing email with the same content.

 * Feb 1: After getting an email advertising a pay-per-view adult entertainment movie starring myself - which I posted on Twitter - I received an email from N26 warning me about the dangers of misidentifying random spam as coming from a reputable source.

 * Jan 28: After thorough cleaning of my keyboard, my Macbook Air is in pristine condition. With a larger SSD than the one I paid for, I think I got a very good deal from backmarket.fr. Sure, it is a company where some backroom deals are not impossible - it is a backmarket after all - but, frankly, when caught with their pants down, they will immediately react and they will solve your problem. M2, 512GB SSD, 24GB of RAM for 1250€ is a steal. The battery had only 87 cycles.

 * Jan 24: My extended family is once again playing the same game that they did during the second season - I get a connection request on a social network from a woman who knows someone else - simultaneous with a notification from one of the companies in France taking part in the affair. I used to get these a lot during the second season - the 2012-2019 period - sometimes they kept using long-forgotten girls from my childhood and high-school years. I also got some during the third season - the current period. It is not clear if she was supposed to gain knowledge of my anatomy - or to see that I was unemployed. During the third season I would usually also get a job offer where they will be making it clear that I am to accept this game without saying anything. And before you ask, as far as I know, I am not adopted.

 * Jan 20: Only two of the companies contacted following the DDoS *incident* did answer - Google with an automated response and Hetzner who told me that without further input from me, they will consider the incident resolved. Well, I confirm, it has been resolved - I am keeping the keyboard with the sticky keys from backmarket.fr and you are keeping your current situation.

 * Jan 15: When not compiling, my new Macbook Air draws 1 amp which means that one good sunny day during the summer gives me about 60 hours of use. My 27" screen draws 2.5 amps which is about 24 hours of use per sunny day in the summer.

 * Jan 13: First day of this winter on which I am able to run my diesel heater entirely on solar power. From now on the days will be getting longer, the Sun will be reaching higher and the average temperature will be rising.

 * Jan 10: I just received another job offer from the French state unemployment agency - for a data engineer. I have got three of them for the last year - one after being evicted from my home, another one on Jan 9 with backmarket.fr and the today's one. After getting it, I was reminded to stop talking about this affair by a Google engineer. This is precisely the kind of [behavior](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/issues/1774) which once again confirms why something must happen at Google. Don't use technical forums for extortion and people won't be complaining about it.

 * Jan 9: I just received my new Macbook Air from backmarket.fr. With some very minor scratches and signs of use, it is incredibly good value in my situation. I am currently looking at options for converting one of my 27" screens to 12V using a DC-DC step-up. I am finally completely set up to resume working on IT. On the other hand, the RATP experiment is not very successful. After testing, it can be concluded that the bug very commonly found in some early RPGs of the '90s - where you could rob a bank while simultaneously giving a coin to a beggar and not be considered a criminal - does not seem to work in real life. *As a side note, on my old Macbook Pro 2013, for which I did not have the required electricity used to have a problem with the keyboard - the keyboard on my Macbook Air 2010 was in perfect condition - but for both of them I had to use OpenCore with many new features not working anymore - including sleep - I had to shut it down instead of closing the lid - and it had only 4GB of RAM - the note is important because my new _refurbished_ keyboard also needs cleaning.*

 * Jan 8: I just received a response from backmarket.fr who told me that they had replaced my Macbook Air with another with the same amount of RAM memory and a larger SSD drive - it is on its way shipped by UPS. Simultaneously with this response, I also received a job offer from the French National Unemployment Office for a system administrator at RATP - the state-owned company who runs the Parisian subway who have been tracking me - I sent them a CV as well as a link to my Github profile.

 * Jan 8: There has been a few more rounds of DDoS attacks on my Star Citizen site by hosts carrying old Macos IDs - what may appear to be a real botnet is actually composed of a very small number of ASNs - and they are located mostly at hosting providers - I have joined the IP sorted IPs in `DDoS_IPs_2024_01.txt`. Among the  companies involved one can site Hetzner - where velivole.fr used to be hosted, before they made it clear that they were spying on the traffic, Microsoft - who took part in the penisgate in the Node.js project, Apple - a newcomer, Huawei - a newcomer, Google - by now the list is too long, Bytedance - who took part in the previous DoSing, and many other brave companies who decided to go where no company has been before.

 * Jan 7: The backmarket.fr support told me that they were unable to replace my Macbook and offered me a model with less RAM, which I refused. I got simultaneous DDoS attack on my Star Citizen site from a few dozen hosts with MacOS IDs with this message.

 * Jan 5: As the Chronopost parcel containing my refurbished Macbook traveled back to its vendor on backmarket.fr, I got SMS messages from a private phone number containing the shipment details of a fictitious MondialRelay package.

 * Dec 31: I was able to receive my refurbished Macbook Air without too much trouble - not counting the fact that I received a phishing SMS from a private phone instead of the official UPS code when I used the two factor authentication - but this was certainly my telecom provider - Free - by now their situation is similar to Google - and UPS had probably nothing to do with it. Alas, my refurbished Macbook had a number of keys on the keyboard that were short-circuited and were not working so I had to send it back.

 * Dec 30: Someone subscribed me with my new Salvation Army address to the Leroy-Merlin newsletters - another shop where it was vital to know what exactly I had been buying - I bought the cardboard boxes that I used to pack my stuff from my apartment.

 * Dec 26: I am currently considering buying an refurbished Macbook since my 12V Macbook is a 2010 model. I was looking at the various offers on [backmarket.com](https://backmarket.com) and when I finally decided to get money from retirement plan, I got an SMS from MondialRelay who used to block my parcels - after initially just snooping. It is an SMS from their official platform but contains a phishing URL. My telecom operator - Free - and my bank - Crédit Mutuel gave this information. For now, it is not clear if backmarket.com and UPS will also take part in the extortion.

 * Dec 10: The very first day I started researching my article on the Forez crusading family in the François Mitterrand French National Library, someone opened my locker (one has to leave all personal belongings in a locker before being able to enter the library) and left it wide open. I started using scotch tape to see if someone continued to open it and today someone had simply folded it back on itself - in order for this to be as obvious as possible - I also got a call from the Viagra numbers when it happened - I did file an official complaint this time.

 * Dec 9: Besides always switching off my cellphone, I started using cash to prevent further identification of the supermarkets I was using. I used my Crédit Mutuel card to draw some money from an ATM and 20 minutes later I received a notification from my N26 card (Crédit Mutuel's mobile app cannot send free text notifications) that I had nothing to worry about and I could continue to use my card.

 * Dec 7: I was preparing to go to sleep at a parking in Le Mée-sur-Seine - I had not turned off my cellphone - when someone dressed as private security officer armed with a flashlight knocked on my door - he told me that he wanted to see my face because I did not speak very well French and could have been a pedophile - I got out of the van and saw that he was driving a car with German registration - I hesitated calling the police but alas impersonating a private security officer is not a felony - unlike impersonating a police officer. Still, one must note the very slight increase in cerebral activity since one year ago when the real police came armed to my home to try to intimidate me - someone had told them that by using the codeword *conspiracy* they could prevent me from saying what happened.

 * Dec 2: Since I declared my new postal address at the Salvation Army, someone subscribed me to the LIDL newsletter at this address. This is the address I gave to the Post Office in order to forward my mail - because of a character length limitation it was written in a very peculiar way. The Post Office has been giving access to my mail for almost 10 years now and LIDL provide access to my shopping receipts since at least 2022.

 * Nov 26: I am one of the homeless people present at the camp next to the French Minister in charge of Housing protesting against the lack of shelters for homeless people, I usually provide night watch

 * Nov 25: Someone is posting in the [DAL](https://www.droitaulogement.org/) WhatsApp group simultaneous with the same calls I have been getting.

 * Nov 25: Since I created a TikTok account a few days ago, I have been getting simultaneous notifications from them with calls from the Viagra numbers. It is not immediately clear if TikTok or Google are the ones doing this. Google have greatly contributed to the *anatomy investigation* since day 1 by kindly providing access to my emails.

 * Nov 19-23: After trying - unsuccessfully - to play the *"you are imagining things"* game in the open-source geospatial data world, first for $5/month, then for $50/month, Mr. Biggus tried the same using my family in Bulgaria for 300€. My ultra-conservative family, an ideal model family for people studying Freud, was involved in the very first phase of this affair - being misled into helping lead the *investigation* into my anatomy and eventual sexual practices - including interviewing all my ex-girlfriends on the false pretense that they helping me to recover from a *problem*. Shame and the fact that some members of my extended family seem to have accepted payment in order to mislead my immediate family made that they took the decision to back the extortion. They still maintain that they do not know anything. This same *investigation* is also what motivated the initial false rape charges - use the police to retrieve a couple of sex tapes and my sex toys. Psychiatrists will have the final say in this affair, but I strongly suspect that the underlying unconscious driver of this extreme voyeurism was a case of [projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_projection). I am sorry, Mr. Biggus, but I invite you once again to check the prices for prostitution involving weird sexual practices in the highly-educated world. Also, I remind you that while the sex work laws vary greatly across different countries, forced sex work is highly criminal in every jurisdiction.

 * Nov 22: I am on the way to solve my electricity problem, I have installed a 220v charger that allows me the charge the cell batteries at RV charging stations - there is a few of them around Paris - and I will soon have a dedicated gasoline electricity generator - this will allow me to use my 12v Macbook Air at will. It will also allow me to use my very efficient Webasto diesel heater instead of running the main engine. This morning I woke up at 1.5° in the van.

 * Nov 14: First night in a homeless shelter. Once I have stable access to electricity, I will probably start a French/English language blogs detailing my experience with this, hopefully final, phase of my affair. When I received my SMS with my code, I also received another SMS from the French government-run volunteer register. A few years ago, when I became permanently unemployed, I tried becoming a volunteer teacher for IT skills for people in need. I got a refusal and ever since, I often get a text from them simultaneous with some other event. For example, during one of my last job interviews - with a French state-run agency who spontaneously contacted me - they tried to convince me that I lacked the needed experience for working as an entry-level PHP developer - and then I got a simultaneous SMS from the national volunteer register. It is not very clear if this is organized with the state agency running the homeless shelters or simply with my telecom operator which has been kindly providing my traffic dumps and call logs.

 * Nov 13: I was finally able to obtain a place in a homeless shelter run by the French state, however the first night I did not get the SMS that was supposed to get me there. I have become a regular member of [DAL](https://www.droitaulogement.org/), a non-profit that defends the rights of homeless people, and I am regularly attending all their actions and protests. This is the first time I am taking part in any form of political activism since the fall of the Berlin wall 30 years ago. As I am ideologically very close to the Salvation Army, I decided to use them as my current postal address. This is also one of the very few groups of people I regularly meet for the last 5 or 6 years that haven't tried to convince me that I suffer from psychosis - mostly using dicks and viagra - and the very first time since 2022. The very few other occasions were several groups of fellow paragliding pilots I have met in the French Alps - and my first Star Citizen orgs - before CIG decided to lend a hand.

 * Nov 4: I was able to retrieve most of my items from my home, now I have warm clothes and cold is no longer that much of a problem, I liquidated some stocks to rent a storage box and moved my stuff there for the time being. Electricity is still a huge problem because my campervan was made for summer use and the solar energy available in Paris during the winter is next to none.

 * Oct 29: I was offered a job and return to relative normalcy if I accept to stop talking about this affair - which obviously I can no longer allow. If you are curious about the company where this is business as usual - the recruiting agency is [Welcome to the Jungle](https://www.welcometothejungle.com/) (*name checks out*) with offices in the US, France, Spain and other countries, the company is [Discngine](https://www.discngine.com/) and the offer was relayed though the French state unemployment office which have been involved in this affair since I was fired for filing a complaint.

 * Oct 27: I am trying to find a place in a homeless shelter. France being a social welfare state, this situation would normally be impossible to happen, but in this case, there was at least some degree of criminal complicity by all parties involved.

* **Oct 24: I am now homeless and living in my van. I lost access to most of my computer hardware. The eviction from my home has been timed for maximum effect as I was not present when it happened. I have only a single set of clothes and no means to get anything else. Please, if you use my software, consider asking everyone around you if they are taking part in this extortion and why.**

# My work

I am an unemployed IT engineer living on social welfare in a legal *no-man's-land* and working full-time on open-source software.

You can find a brief summary of my situation at the end.

My current main area of expertise is linking C++ and JavaScript.

My main projects are:
 * [SWIG JavaScript Evolution](https://github.com/mmomtchev/swig)  - An automatic bindings generator/compiler for C/C++ libraries, produces dual-environment bindings - Node.js native addon and a WASM bundle
 * The [`hadron`](https://github.com/mmomtchev/hadron) build system for JavaScript - A `meson`-based alternative to `node-gyp` that supports dual-environment C/C++ projects, `conan` integration and can use *xPacks* for a completely self-contained build that does not assume anything about the user host
 * [`libnode`](https://github.com/mmomtchev/libnode) - a GSoC-sponsored project that allows to easily call JavaScript subroutines from C++ using Node-API - alas, this project is currently frozen at Node.js 18.x since I have been banned from interacting with the Node.js' projects on github (see my story at the end for more details on this *incident*)
 * [`nobind17`](https://github.com/mmomtchev/nobind) - an experiment in developing the next generation automatic bindings for C++ and JavaScript - inspired by `pybind11` but with a focus on C++17

Additionally, I have authored and maintain a number of bindings of C/C++ libraries for JavaScript:

 * [`magickwand.js`](https://github.com/mmomtchev/magickwand.js)

    The SWIG JSE showcase project, fully automatic SWIG JSE-generated bindings for ImageMagick for JavaScript - 400k of C++ code generated with 600 lines of SWIG code, native addon in Node.js, WASM bundle in the browser, web-bundler friendly, async support and TypeScript support

 * [`node-gdal-async`](https://github.com/mmomtchev/node-gdal-async) 
 
    Fork of the no longer maintained `gdal`/`gdal-next`
    GDAL bindings for Node.js
    An early generation Node.js addon using NAN, I transformed the sync bindings in async bindings

   - [`ndarray-gdal`](https://github.com/mmomtchev/ndarray-gdal) is the [`scijs`](https://github.com/scijs/ndarray) plugin
   - [`gdal-exprtk`](https://github.com/mmomtchev/gdal-exprtk) is the [`ExprTk.js`](https://github.com/mmomtchev/exprtk.js) plugin

 * [`everything-json`](https://github.com/mmomtchev/everything-json)

    Node-API manual bindings for `simdjson`, the fastest JSON parser in the world, the everything JSON parser for Node.js - asynchronous, very high performance, yieldable and with partial decoding support - check it to see why JSON parsing is such a problem in Node.js (it is synchronous!)

 * [`sqlite-wasm-http`](https://github.com/mmomtchev/sqlite-wasm-http)

    `embind` semi-automatic bindings for `sqlite3` for WASM with a transparent SQL over plain HTTP support, inspired by phiresky's original implementation for `sqlite.js`

 * [`@mmomtchev/ffmpeg`](https://github.com/mmomtchev/ffmpeg)

    The `nobind17` showcase project, semi-automatic `nobind17` bindings for ffmpeg for Node.js - complete with a native streams API, async support and Typescript support

 * [`proj.js`](https://github.com/mmomtchev/proj.js)
 
    Another SWIG JSE project, still under development, fully automatic SWIG JSE-generated bindings for a project with advanced C++17 features

* [`ExprTk.js`](https://github.com/mmomtchev/exprtk.js) / [`jeetah`](https://github.com/mmomtchev/jeetah)

    Node-API manual bindings for ExprTk for Node.js including an experimental JIT compiler that allows to run parallel vector calculations on `TypedArray`s without being constrained by the V8 monothreaded model

# Websites

I also do lots of browser JS / web development:
* [velivole.fr / meteo.guru](https://www.velivole.fr) - is a free soaring weather site for paragliding, hang-gliding and sail-plane pilots. It is complex application which includes a **vanilla JS / OpenLayers 6 / custom webpack** front-end, an **Express.js/Node.js** backend and a **Node.js/C++** computational engine for specialized numerical weather prediction that consists of a secondary model running on top of the French and German national weather models. You can see an overview of velivole/meteo.guru [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmomtchev/mmomtchev/master/velivole.fr-Architecture-Overview.svg) and explore its API [here](https://www.velivole.fr/apidoc/). The website includes a number of GIS innovations, including the remote querying of MVT data using [query-mvt](https://github.com/mmomtchev/query-mvt). It is also the very first site in the world to support the displaying of remote MBTiles maps using [ol-mbtiles](https://github.com/mmomtchev/ol-mbtiles). Almost all of my GIS software listed above is used in some way on this site.
* [xc-db.velivole.fr](https://xcdb.velivole.fr) - an [open-sourced](https://github.com/mmomtchev/xc-db) navigator/explorer that can uses basic machine-learning (an algorithm loosely based on K-means clustering) to deduce the typical routes pilots will take depending on the prevailing winds by classifying all paragliding flights of the French Federal Distance Cup of the French Paragliding Association. **Node.js/Express.js/gdal-async** backend with a **React/Redux/rlayers** front-end. *No mobile version available at the moment.* The sites is a demonstration of the capabilities of `gdal-async` used with Express.js and `rlayers` as it includes a dynamically computed particle visualization entirely in React/rlayers that uses an SQL database with 700M lines.
* [isitplausible.com](https://isitplausible.com) - a StackOverflow-inspired website for analyzing the scientific accuracy of Sci-Fi movies, books and video games. **Node.js/Express.js** backend with **React/Next.js**, this was my first foray in the world of server-side rendering with React.
* [scodex.garga.net](https://scodex.garga.net) - the first attempt of creating an universal Codex website for the (forever) upcoming Star Citizen by CIG with information extracted from the game files using [`scdatatools`](https://gitlab.com/scmodding/frameworks/scdatatools) in Node.js / TypeScript environment with `pymport`. The site also makes heavy use of `gdal-async`, `rlayers`, `node-magickwand` and `scijs` through `ndarray-gdal` because it includes detailed 2D/3D maps of the planets and some basic extrasolar astronomy. Backend-less design with server-rendered **React** using **Next.js 13**.
* [aircalc.velivole.fr](https://aircalc.velivole.fr/) - a thermodynamics air parcel calculator for weather, online version of [velitherm-visu](https://github.com/mmomtchev/velitherm-visu), raw **React**.
* [xc-score](https://www.velivole.fr/xc-score/) - online version of * [igc-xc-score](https://github.com/mmomtchev/igc-xc-score) - **vanilla JS** with a **custom webpack**.

# Mobile applications

* [velivole-mobile](https://github.com/mmomtchev/velivole-mobile) - the open-sourced mobile counterpart to velivole.fr, in its current iteration it is based on React Native / expo.

# Timewasters

* [r/dataisbeautiful](https://github.com/mmomtchev/data-is-beautiful) - a collection of data visualizations produced with [magickwand.js](https://github.com/mmomtchev/magickwand.js) and [node-ffmpeg](https://github.com/mmomtchev/node-ffmpeg)

Besides writing software, I have been trying, for almost 10 years now, to create a video as stunningly beautiful as [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bZ1YG68U) that I saw when I started [paragliding](https://github.com/mmomtchev/mmomtchev/blob/master/AERIAL_SPORTS.md). I have come [a long way](https://www.youtube.com/user/momtchev) since I started in [2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzTU611kfrw).

I also used to spent lots of time doing blue water sailing before my affair spiraled out of control.

I am an active member of the French Paragliding and Hang-gliding Federation <https://www.ffvl.fr> and (currently) an inactive member of the French Sailing Federation <https://www.ffvoile.fr>.

# Future projects

Should I have funding (it is absolutely pointless to seek any deals involving this affair since I am obviously ready to not have enough to eat in order to win), the following projects could see the light of the day:

* `jimport` - the inverse of `pymport` - instantly gain the most significant advantage of Node.js when using Django - **sharing code with the front-end** - at the cost of a significantly increased memory footprint - but without any execution time penalties
   - this project is currently blocked by the `libnode` situation

* A spiritual successor to SWIG that uses the LLVM front-end to generate cross-language bindings using `pybind11`, `embind` and `nobind17`
   
* Porting the Python dynamic linker to the WASM platform - this would allow to have a full Python interpreter - compatible with all Python modules - as a platform-independent WASM binary - that could run even in the browser - and/or be transparently installed by `npm`

# My current situation

![Eunuch Programmers](https://orel.garga.net/image-3175739551.jpg)

I am an unemployed IT engineer living on social welfare in a legal *no-man's-land* and working full-time on open-source software.

An ex-employer of mine who needed to prove something of sexual nature to his immediate entourage (all of this happened after I left his company):

 * Tried buying people in my entourage - I was in my late 20s - in order to play games of intimate nature with people I knew
 * Bought someone in my extended family in Bulgaria (I am a Bulgarian national who has spent most of his adult life in France) to serve as a cover story - in fact this person had little to do with most of this affair
 * Ended organizing false rape charges - on three different occasions - investigated twice by the French "police" - once going through a criminal courts - where the affair was covered up by the judges and a lawyer with a Wikipedia page who is the current president of the French ADL - as the affair had far reaching consequences for several politically exposed names in French IT business and politics - and involved Parisian night-life, various legal and illegal drugs, ED enhancers and unusual sexual practices - it was covered up without any proceedings or written documents
 * Normally, at this point, I should have received a huge severance package and everything should have stopped here - however as the guy who started it all was unable to admit the very reason that motivated the whole affair, everything did continue
 * My extended family in Bulgaria - who hardly knew me - fell easily to the promise that everything could be "fixed" - without going public with the sexual details - and by the time they realized their error, they had already committed numerous felonies - it should also be noted that the generation of my parents grew up during the Brezhnev era - when an affair involving sexual deviation by a man in position of power - and backed the by police - would have been absolutely impossible to win - fact that was ruthlessly exploited by elements having a political police background who were recruited by political means through the Council of Europe
 * At this point they tried extorting me with all the sexual elements of the affair - without any success - from this point on the French police started taking active part in the affair
 * In order to stop me from talking, my next employer took part in an absolutely shocking sexual harassment - including references to penises and viagra - all while pretending that it was all a coincidence and I was being psychotic
 * Absolutely the same game started in the paragliding world - by buying off people and offering sponsorships - most of them official - as at this point, the involvement of the police and courts offered total immunity
 * After a few years, I started developing a psychosomatic response linked to the pronunciation of certain words - those that were used to make me react in order to say that I was seeing things - at this point the affair passed through the official French work-illness commission - and it was once again covered up
 * When it became impossible to pretend that nothing happened, I was fired from my job - a psychiatrist appointed by my employer declared me psychotic - and then another round of lawsuits were covered up - adding many new lawyers and judges to the affair - including at the EU level - where I sued the French state for denying me the right to a fair trial
 * From this point on, I have been working on open source software while living on social welfare with a few bucks per day - and much of what happened earlier is being repeated in the open source projects I have worked in
 * My phone company, my bank and my insurance company have all been involved - frequently showing it clearly as an intimidation tactic
 * Last year, I was banned from the Node.js project after the French police came - illegally - to my home - with their guns drawn - to try to intimidate me - during the next few days all projects I had worked in posted simultaneous messages - and Node.js banned me because I said what had happened
 * By now, the affair has included companies such as Google, Facebook, X (Twitter), Microsoft and Amazon - many of them - especially Google - being involved in the penis games - and the extortion - for example recently my insurance company stole part of my food money from me by falsifying documents - and then they went to simultaneously send me an SMS along with a message in a Google-backed opensource project to show me that it was part of the extortion
 * It also includes all my online accounts - even things like my Discord, Steam, Spotify, Sonetel, CIG (producers of Star Citizen - this affair is very active there at the moment) - or for example even my [`uptimerobot.com`](https://uptimerobot.com) - where recently they did take part in a DoS against my website by Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon

I am being offered a job - if I accept to never talk about this affair again - and accept that the penis game continues - because the organizer of the affair needs to be able to explain it - and because this game is impossible when I am talking. Because this cannot be organized in a normal company, I must also accept a dummy position in a criminal team where I won't be allowed to work - in order to stop the affair from blowing. Neither of these is acceptable to me - the sexual harassment or to not be allowed to work.
 
I have started maintaining a list of the companies where the kind of deal I am offered is possible - there are some very large French and US companies in it - you can find it [here](https://github.com/mmomtchev/mmomtchev/blob/master/BUSINESS-AS-USUAL.md).

*I am maintaining a large number of binary Node.js projects - if you use any of them, you should know that I am ready to provide pre-built binaries for Macbooks with Apple Silicon if someone provides me a remote access to such hardware. If paying by the hour, expect about an hour of average daily usage. If you care only about the software and do not want be involved with the criminal affair, there are various options for anonymous sponsorship.*
