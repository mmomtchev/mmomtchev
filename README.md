My name is Momtchil Momtchev and I am an IT engineer with almost 30 years of experience.

My fields of expertise include:
* TCP/IP stacks and networking code
* Operating systems and Node.js
* Geospatial data
* Super-computing and parallel processing

I am currently unemployed because I am at the center of [The Penisgate Affair](https://github.com/mmomtchev/mmomtchev/blob/master/PENISGATE.md) - and its various protagonists are trying to starve me to death. If you run a business, you value quality work and you have no interest whatsoever in covering up criminals with badges, I will be glad to hear from you.

While unemployed, I am working mostly on geospatial software for Node.js.

Besides writing software, I have been trying, for almost 10 years now, to create a video as stunningly beautiful as [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bZ1YG68U) that I saw when I started [paragliding](https://github.com/mmomtchev/mmomtchev/blob/master/AERIAL_SPORTS.md). I have come [a long way](https://www.youtube.com/user/momtchev) since I started in [2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzTU611kfrw).

I am also the creator and the maintainer of <https://www.velivole.fr> (French) and <https://www.meteo.guru> (English), the leading free soaring weather site in Europe and the author and maintainer of <https://isitplausible.com>.

I am a huge fan of blue water sailing.

I am an active member of the French Paragliding and Hang-gliding Federation <https://www.ffvl.fr> and (currently) an inactive member of the French Sailing Federation <https://www.ffvoile.fr>.
