I am an unemployed engineer that has been living on social welfare for the last 3 years. I am writing open-source software both as a pass-time and also to raise awareness about my situation - I am currently being extorted by a cartel of French IT companies over a remarkably ugly sexual harassment affaire organized with the help of the Judicial system in order to cover up the very embarrassing problem of one person.

The affair is absolutely huge because of the involvement of a large number of French companies with more than 1B€ annual turnover, a good number of persons with Wikipedia pages - both in French business and French politics, the French public administration and the French police. Recently, several very large US companies (more than $1B annual), where obviously such deals are not a problem - have also extended me job offers which included sexual harassment - something they made obvious during the recruitment process. I am totally unwilling to prostitute myself - I have an university degree and a very good and sought up skill set and I fully intend to continue working in IT.

Should you find any of my skills useful to your company - a company not interested in fixing sexually-motivated criminal affairs in the French Judicial system - I will be more than willing to talk to you. Since my ex-boss is usually offering to sell me under my level in exchange for sexual harassment - I am extending the same deal to every company unwilling to take part in this.

**I am the kind of guy who chose to live in extreme poverty in order to be able to have a real job instead of a make-believe position in a company willing to cover up this affair. You will never find a better deal on the IT job market.**

Currently I am living with a few bucks per day and the people behind the extortion are sending me, in between the sexual content, advertisements for food. 

My projects:

* [libnode](https://github.com/mmomtchev/libnode) - Node.js-as-a-shared-library allowing easy calling of JS code from compiled C and C++ applications through the Node-API (C) and `node-addon-api` (C++) interfaces with Ubuntu/Debian packages, created as part of GSoC 2022
* [node-gdal-async](https://github.com/mmomtchev/node-gdal-async) - I am actively developing the GDAL bindings for Node.js which used to be abandoned by its creator
  - [ndarray-gdal](https://github.com/mmomtchev/ndarray-gdal) is the [scijs](https://github.com/scijs/ndarray) plugin

* [ExprTk.js](https://github.com/mmomtchev/exprtk.js) - asynchronous Node.js bindings for [ExprTk](http://www.partow.net/programming/exprtk/index.html) - a mathematical expression engine - allowing for an effortless multithreading of computationally heavy tasks by supporting asynchronous execution of thunks precompiled from strings - it will eventually be supported by both `gdal-async` and `scijs`
* [jeetah](https://github.com/mmomtchev/jeetah) - an optimizing compiler for mathematical expressions in JavaScript
* [react-native-settings](https://github.com/mmomtchev/react-native-settings) - an all-in-one component for creating cross-platform settings (preferences) screens with React Native

* [documentation-hipster](https://github.com/mmomtchev/documentation-hipster) - is a beautiful `documentation.js` Bootstrap-based theme with support for TypeScript and React components - one of its goals is to provide an almost drop-in replacement for the seemingly dying [react-styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/) project
* [igc-xc-score](https://github.com/mmomtchev/igc-xc-score) - an open-source solution for scoring paragliding XC competitions - which is a very interesting linear optimization problem with a *O(n^5)* worst case complexity
* [XC-DB](https://github.com/mmomtchev/xc-db) - an open-source interactive browser for paragliding flight tracks implemented in React, Redux and rlayers for the front-end and Node.js, Express, gdal-async and ndarray for the back-end

Besides writing software, I have been trying, for almost 10 years now, to create a video as stunningly beautiful as [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bZ1YG68U) that I saw when I started [paragliding](https://github.com/mmomtchev/mmomtchev/blob/master/AERIAL_SPORTS.md). I have come [a long way](https://www.youtube.com/user/momtchev) since I started in [2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzTU611kfrw).

I am also the creator and the maintainer of <https://www.velivole.fr> (French) and <https://www.meteo.guru> (English), the leading free soaring weather site in Europe and the author and maintainer of <https://isitplausible.com>. You can see an overview of velivole/meteo.guru [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmomtchev/mmomtchev/master/velivole.fr-Architecture-Overview.svg) and explore its API [here](https://www.velivole.fr/apidoc/).

I am a huge fan of blue water sailing.

I am an active member of the French Paragliding and Hang-gliding Federation <https://www.ffvl.fr> and (currently) an inactive member of the French Sailing Federation <https://www.ffvoile.fr>.
