My name is Momtchil Momtchev and I am an IT engineer with almost 30 years of experience.

My fields of expertise include:
* TCP/IP stacks and networking code
* Operating systems and Node.js
* Geospatial data
* Super-computing and parallel processing

I am currently unemployed because a number of my previous employers are trying to cover up a remarkably ugly sexual affair with the help of the French judiciary and are extorting me to accept a job offer coming from an employer willing to participate in the cover up ([you can read about it here](https://github.com/mmomtchev/mmomtchev/blob/master/PENISGATE.md)). I have excellent technical and personal skills and I wish to work for a normal company which does not take part in this affair.

Alas, yes, this is the sorry state of the [French Tech](https://github.com/mmomtchev/mmomtchev/blob/master/LA-FRENCH-TECH.md) and the French judiciary system and no, they are not very competitive outside of France.

While unemployed, I am working mostly on software around geospatial and scientific data, some frontend and lots of Node.js internals.
My current main project is `ExprTk.js` which adds an asynchronous mathematical expression evaluator supporting multithreaded and asynchronous versions of `TypedArray.map`, `TypedArray.reduce` and `eval`.

If your company needs an excellent engineer who takes pride in the quality of his work and do not have interest in covering up crimes in the French Judiciary, do not hesitate to contact me. My current financial situation is very dire and I will readily accept any work which does not involve extortion over that affair.

Besides writing software, I have been trying, for almost 10 years now, to create a video as stunningly beautiful as [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bZ1YG68U) that I saw when I started [paragliding](https://github.com/mmomtchev/mmomtchev/blob/master/AERIAL_SPORTS.md). I have come [a long way](https://www.youtube.com/user/momtchev) since I started in [2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzTU611kfrw).

I am also the creator and the maintainer of <https://www.velivole.fr> (French) and <https://www.meteo.guru> (English), the leading free soaring weather site in Europe and the author and maintainer of <https://isitplausible.com>. You can see an overview of velivole/meteo.guru [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmomtchev/mmomtchev/master/velivole.fr-Architecture-Overview.svg) and explore its API [here](https://www.velivole.fr/apidoc/).

I am a huge fan of blue water sailing.
