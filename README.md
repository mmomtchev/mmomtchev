My name is Momtchil Momtchev and I am an IT engineer with almost 30 years of experience.

My fields of expertise include:
* TCP/IP stacks and networking code
* Operating systems and Node.js
* Geospatial data
* Super-computing and parallel processing

I am currently unemployed because I am at the center of [The Penisgate Affair](https://github.com/mmomtchev/mmomtchev/blob/master/PENISGATE.md). The affair boils down to an ex-employer organizing a giant penis-size game both at my next job, a sports federation and almost everywhere else - and then tried to, unsuccessfully, convince me that I was suffering from psychosis and was seeing penises everywhere. The police is involved too. As the affair involves very serious failures of the judicial system in France and a few large companies, all of this over a personal weakness, everyone is hell-bend on keeping it under wraps. The affair is constantly being covered up by buying off my lawyers and reaching back-doors deals with judges. As lots of companies are involved, they are currently waiting for my unemployment benefits to expire so that they can extort me to shut up. Most of the Javascript ecosystem and a few very large GIS companies have accepted to take part in the penis-size game, while my telecom and my hosting operators are providing detailed transcripts of my TCP/IP traffic - which are then shown to me. My bank is doing the same and so are some lawyers - including some very famous prestigious Parisian law firms - that I have contacted for this affair.

Alas, yes, this is the sorry state of the [French Tech](https://github.com/mmomtchev/mmomtchev/blob/master/LA-FRENCH-TECH.md) and no, they are not very competitive outside of France.

While unemployed, I am working mostly on geospatial software for Node.js. I am currently working to restore/reimplement the C++ support in `documentation.js`.

If your company needs an excellent engineer who takes pride in the quality of his work, do not hesitate to contact me. Otherwise I will have to resort to stealing food from the supermarket very soon - especially since I am eager to explain myself to a judge as currently my criminal complaints are covered up.

Besides writing software, I have been trying, for almost 10 years now, to create a video as stunningly beautiful as [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bZ1YG68U) that I saw when I started [paragliding](https://github.com/mmomtchev/mmomtchev/blob/master/AERIAL_SPORTS.md). I have come [a long way](https://www.youtube.com/user/momtchev) since I started in [2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzTU611kfrw).

I am also the creator and the maintainer of <https://www.velivole.fr> (French) and <https://www.meteo.guru> (English), the leading free soaring weather site in Europe and the author and maintainer of <https://isitplausible.com>. You can see an overview of velivole/meteo.guru [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmomtchev/mmomtchev/master/velivole.fr-Architecture-Overview.svg) and explore its API [here](https://www.velivole.fr/apidoc/).

I am a huge fan of blue water sailing.

I am an active member of the French Paragliding and Hang-gliding Federation <https://www.ffvl.fr> and (currently) an inactive member of the French Sailing Federation <https://www.ffvoile.fr>.
