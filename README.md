# Because overthrowing an entrenched dictator is difficult
[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/%23IStandWithRussia-againstPutin-critical)](https://github.com/vshymanskyy/StandWithUkraine/blob/main/docs/ToRussianPeople.md)

Throughout history, there are but a handful of examples when an entrenched dictator was brought down by popular uprising - and it always involved extreme hunger and bloodshed.

As we are gradually completely overcoming hunger in our modern society, toppling a totalitarian regime becomes more and more difficult.

It takes more than moral ethics to stand up against violent repression.

This is why I want to remind everyone that in this difficult moment, just as Ukraine needs your help against the Russian army, so does the average Russian protester against Putin.

Putin is not a Russian internal affair anymore.

I am currently unemployed because I am suing a big French company over a rather ugly and remarkably embarrassing sexual harassment affair and they are currently openly extorting me with the help of the French IT recruiters to abstain from further lawsuits - and to never mention again what happened - *yes, this is totally possible in France, and no, the French Tech is not very competitive on the global markets*.

*And before someone asks - I will not take up any job offer as part of a settlement of this affair. I believe in hard work and the only type of job offers I am willing to consider is skilled work in exchange for payment.*

Until the situation is resolved, I am working on various open-source projects and I am available for consulting work - or long-term commitment for interesting projects. I have a rather broad skill set:
* Everyday languages: C++ / JavaScript / TypeScript
* My main area of expertise at the moment is Node.js C++ addons and V8
* GIS, spatial algorithms, HPC, parallel computing
* Linux, FreeBSD and OpenBSD kernel experience, especially the TCP/IP stacks
* Some React and front-end experience

At the moment I am working mostly on [jeetah](https://github.com/mmomtchev/jeetah), an optimizing compiler for mathematical expressions in JavaScript.

You can check:

* [node-gdal-async](https://github.com/mmomtchev/node-gdal-async) - I am actively developing the GDAL bindings for Node.js which used to be abandoned by its creator
  - [ndarray-gdal](https://github.com/mmomtchev/ndarray-gdal) is the [scijs](https://github.com/scijs/ndarray) plugin
  - [gdal-exprtk](https://github.com/mmomtchev/gdal-exprtk) is the [ExprTk.js](https://github.com/mmomtchev/exprtk.js) plugin
* [rlayers](https://github.com/mmomtchev/rlayers) - a set of React components for creating online maps with OpenLayers
* [ExprTk.js](https://github.com/mmomtchev/exprtk.js) - asynchronous Node.js bindings for [ExprTk](http://www.partow.net/programming/exprtk/index.html) - a mathematical expression engine - allowing for an effortless multithreading of computationally heavy tasks by supporting asynchronous execution of thunks precompiled from strings - it will eventually be supported by both `gdal-async` and `scijs`
* [jeetah](https://github.com/mmomtchev/jeetah) - an optimizing compiler for mathematical expressions in JavaScript
* [react-edit-list](https://github.com/mmomtchev/react-edit-list) - an universal editable ListView React component that can interact with an external API
* [intercity.js](https://github.com/mmomtchev/intercity) - a still unreleased Work-In-Progress for a dynamic data WMTS/WMS/WCS/WFS server for Node.js
* [documentation-polyglot](https://github.com/mmomtchev/documentation-polyglot) - a plugin that adds *C++* support to `documentation.js` via the new plugin framework that I am currently making
* [documentation-stylist](https://github.com/mmomtchev/documentation-stylist) - is a beautiful `documentation.js` Bootstrap-based theme with support for TypeScript and React components - one of its goals is to provide an almost drop-in replacement for the seemingly dying [react-styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/) project
* [igc-xc-score](https://github.com/mmomtchev/igc-xc-score) - an open-source solution for scoring paragliding XC competitions - which is a very interesting linear optimization problem with a *O(n^5)* worst case complexity
* [velitherm](https://github.com/mmomtchev/velitherm) - an open-source library of basic thermodynamics equations used in soaring weather
  - [velitherm-visu](https://github.com/mmomtchev/velitherm-visu) - is an online air parcel calculator in React that uses the library
* [igc-admin-analyze](https://github.com/mmomtchev/igc-admin-analyze) - a tool for analyzing IGC flight logs giving a percentage of time spent above given administrative divisions defined by their GeoJSON borders
* [geosub](https://github.com/mmomtchev/geosub) - A tool for partial downloading of bands and subwindows from geospatial raster datasets from cloud storage, it is an Amazon AWS-compatible replacement for NOAA's own [g2sub](https://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/filter_gfs_0p25.pl)
* [yatag](https://github.com/mmomtchev/yatag) - is a tool that I use to generate the TypeScript type definitions in most of my projects, it is slowly reaching maturity
* [Queue](https://github.com/mmomtchev/Queue) - is a rather simple but useful package for rate-limiting access to external APIs
* [@mmomtchev/node-pre-gyp-github](https://github.com/mmomtchev/node-pre-gyp-github) - an almost complete rewrite of the popular [node-pre-gyp-github](https://github.com/bchr02/node-pre-gyp-github) abandoned by its author, compatible with the current version of the GitHub API
* [geoapi](https://github.com/mmomtchev/geoapi) - is an open-source server that can translate lat:long coordinates to postal codes (a free GeoNames API), it is based on the proprietary `geodata` in velivole
* [SharedMap](https://github.com/mmomtchev/SharedMap) - is a `Map` that can be accessed by multiple `worker_threads`
* [EDCarnage](https://github.com/mmomtchev/EDCarnage) - an [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) tool for tracking stacked massacre missions in [Elite: Dangerous](https://www.elitedangerous.com/)

Besides writing software, I have been trying, for almost 10 years now, to create a video as stunningly beautiful as [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bZ1YG68U) that I saw when I started [paragliding](https://github.com/mmomtchev/mmomtchev/blob/master/AERIAL_SPORTS.md). I have come [a long way](https://www.youtube.com/user/momtchev) since I started in [2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzTU611kfrw).

I am also the creator and the maintainer of <https://www.velivole.fr> (French) and <https://www.meteo.guru> (English), the leading free soaring weather site in Europe and the author and maintainer of <https://isitplausible.com>. You can see an overview of velivole/meteo.guru [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmomtchev/mmomtchev/master/velivole.fr-Architecture-Overview.svg) and explore its API [here](https://www.velivole.fr/apidoc/).

I am a huge fan of blue water sailing.

I am an active member of the French Paragliding and Hang-gliding Federation <https://www.ffvl.fr> and (currently) an inactive member of the French Sailing Federation <https://www.ffvoile.fr>.
