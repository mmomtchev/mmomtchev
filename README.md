My name is Momtchil Momtchev and I am an IT engineer with almost 30 years of experience.

My fields of expertise include:
* TCP/IP stacks and networking code
* Operating systems and Node.js
* Geospatial data
* Super-computing and parallel processing

I am currently unemployed because a few companies in Paris are extorting me to drop a number of sexual harassment lawsuits - and to discontinue speaking about that affair - which I refuse to do. The affair is remarkably embarrassing as it revolves around a number of serious felonies with sexual motives and covered up by the French justice system - so they are trying to starve me to death.

While unemployed, I am working mostly on geospatial software for Node.js.

  - [ndarray-gdal](https://github.com/mmomtchev/ndarray-gdal) is the [scijs](https://github.com/scijs/ndarray) plugin
* [rlayers](https://github.com/mmomtchev/rlayers) - a set of React components for creating online maps with OpenLayers
* [intercity.js](https://github.com/mmomtchev/intercity) - a still unreleased Work-In-Progress for a dynamic data WMTS/WMS/WCS/WFS server for Node.js
* [igc-xc-score](https://github.com/mmomtchev/igc-xc-score) - is an open-source solution for scoring paragliding XC competitions - which is a very interesting linear optimization problem with a *O(n^5)* worst case complexity
* [Queue](https://github.com/mmomtchev/Queue) - is a rather simple but useful package for rate-limiting access to external APIs
* [SharedMap](https://github.com/mmomtchev/SharedMap) - is a `Map` that can be accessed by multiple `worker_threads`

Besides writing software, I have been trying, for almost 10 years now, to create a video as stunningly beautiful as [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bZ1YG68U) that I saw when I started [paragliding](https://github.com/mmomtchev/mmomtchev/blob/master/AERIAL_SPORTS.md). I have come [a long way](https://www.youtube.com/user/momtchev) since I started in [2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzTU611kfrw).

I am also the creator and the maintainer of <https://www.velivole.fr> (French) and <https://www.meteo.guru> (English), the leading free soaring weather site in Europe and the author and maintainer of <https://isitplausible.com>.

I am a huge fan of blue water sailing.
