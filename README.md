      <p>I am an unemployed IT engineer living on social welfare in a legal <em>no-man's-land</em> after an ex-employer covered up a series of very serious sexually-motivated crimes and tried to extort me to not talk about what happened. The affair has spiraled out ouf control and it involves a very large number of French judicial officials, the French police, politically exposed persons, and many big IT companies such as Google, Twitter, Amazon AWS, OSGeo, the OpenJS Foundation, StackOverflow, some YCombinator companies and even Steam and Cloud Imperium Games.</p>
      <p>I have excellent technical level and solid experience that is not available on the job market. I am looking for a company that will refuse to take part in the extortion - unlike my previous employers.</p>
      <p>This point is absolutely non-negotiable - I am willing to continue to live off social welfare until I find a non-criminal company.</p>
      <p>I also plan to dedicate part of my energy - and my life - to combatting corruption in the French judiciary, police, government administration and the European institutions.</p>
      <p>I invite you to take a look at my projects.</p>

    <p>Je suis un ingénieur en informatique qui vit au RSA en dehors de tout cadre légal. Mes deniers employeurs ont couvert une série de graves délits, dont à la fois la motivation et le caractère sont de nature sexuelle. Ensuite ils ont tenté de faire chantage par le biais des cabinets de recrutement et actuellement on me pose des conditions extraordinaires - y inclus de nature sexuelle - pour que je puisse retravailler. Depuis, l'affaire a été démultipliée en boule de neige et elle implique actuellement des magistrats de justice, la Police Nationale, quelques grands noms de la politique et le business, et les grandes entreprises du secteur comme Google, Twitter, Amazon AWS, OSGeo, la fondation OpenJS, StackOverflow, YCombinator et même Steam et Cloud Imperium Games.</p>
    <p>J'ai un excellent niveau et expérience qu'on ne trouve pas sur le marché du travail. Je suis à la recherche d'une société est prête à refuser de s'impliquer au chantage - ce qui n'a pas été le cas de mes employeurs juqu'au présent.</p>
    <p>Ce point n'est pas à débattre - je suis prêt à vivre au RSA tant que je ne trouve pas une entreprise qui n'est pas criminelle.</p>
    <p>Je compte également dédier une partie de mon énergie - et ma vie - à la lutte contre la corruption au sein du système judiciaire, la police, l'administration publique et les institutions européennes.</p>
    <p>Je vous invite à parcourir la liste de mes projets.</p>

I have started maintaining a list of the companies where the kind of deal I am offered is possible - there are some very large French and US companies in it - you can find it [here](https://github.com/mmomtchev/mmomtchev/blob/master/BUSINESS-AS-USUAL.md).

*I am maintaining a large number of binary Node.js projects - if you use any of them, you should know that I am ready to provide pre-built binaries for Macbooks with Apple Silicon if someone provides me a remote access to such hardware. If paying by the hour, expect about an hour of average daily usage. If you care only about the software and do not want be involved with the criminal affair, there are various options for anonymous sponsorship.*

# Websites

I am mostly a C++/JavaScript integration expert with a focus on V8/Node.js internals, but I also do lots of browser JS / web development:
* [velivole.fr / meteo.guru](https://www.velivole.fr) - is a free soaring weather site for paragliding, hang-gliding and sail-plane pilots. It is complex application which includes a **vanilla JS / OpenLayers 6 / custom webpack** front-end, an **Express.js/Node.js** backend and a **Node.js/C++** computational engine for specialized numerical weather prediction that consists of a secondary model running on top of the French and German national weather models. You can see an overview of velivole/meteo.guru [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmomtchev/mmomtchev/master/velivole.fr-Architecture-Overview.svg) and explore its API [here](https://www.velivole.fr/apidoc/). The website includes a number of GIS innovations, including the remote querying of MVT data using [query-mvt](https://github.com/mmomtchev/query-mvt). It is also the very first site in the world to support the displaying of remote MBTiles maps using [ol-mbtiles](https://github.com/mmomtchev/ol-mbtiles). Almost all of my GIS software listed above is used in some way on this site.
* [xc-db.velivole.fr](https://xcdb.velivole.fr) - an [open-sourced](https://github.com/mmomtchev/xc-db) navigator/explorer that can uses basic machine-learning (an algorithm loosely based on K-means clustering) to deduce the typical routes pilots will take depending on the prevailing winds by classifying all paragliding flights of the French Federal Distance Cup of the French Paragliding Association. **Node.js/Express.js/gdal-async** backend with a **React/Redux/rlayers** front-end. *No mobile version available at the moment.* The sites is a demonstration of the capabilities of `gdal-async` used with Express.js and `rlayers` as it includes a dynamically computed particle visualization entirely in React/rlayers that uses an SQL database with 700M lines.
* [isitplausible.com](https://isitplausible.com) - a StackOverflow-inspired website for analyzing the scientific accuracy of Sci-Fi movies, books and video games. **Node.js/Express.js** backend with **React/Next.js**, this was my first foray in the world of server-side rendering with React.
* [scodex.garga.net](https://scodex.garga.net) - the first attempt of creating an universal Codex website for the (forever) upcoming Star Citizen by CIG with information extracted from the game files using [`scdatatools`](https://gitlab.com/scmodding/frameworks/scdatatools) in Node.js / TypeScript environment with `pymport`. The site also makes heavy use of `gdal-async`, `rlayers`, `node-magickwand` and `scijs` through `ndarray-gdal` because it includes detailed 2D/3D maps of the planets and some basic extrasolar astronomy. Backend-less design with server-rendered **React** using **Next.js 13**.
* [aircalc.velivole.fr](https://aircalc.velivole.fr/) - a thermodynamics air parcel calculator for weather, online version of [velitherm-visu](https://github.com/mmomtchev/velitherm-visu), raw **React**.
* [xc-score](https://www.velivole.fr/xc-score/) - online version of * [igc-xc-score](https://github.com/mmomtchev/igc-xc-score) - **vanilla JS** with a **custom webpack**.

# Mobile applications

* [velivole-mobile](https://github.com/mmomtchev/velivole-mobile) - the open-sourced mobile counterpart to velivole.fr, in its current iteration it is based on React Native / expo.

# Timewasters

* [r/dataisbeautiful](https://github.com/mmomtchev/data-is-beautiful) - a collection of data visualizations produced with [magickwand.js](https://github.com/mmomtchev/magickwand.js) and [node-ffmpeg](https://github.com/mmomtchev/node-ffmpeg)
* [EDCarnage](https://github.com/mmomtchev/EDCarnage) - an [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) tool for tracking stacked massacre missions in [Elite: Dangerous](https://www.elitedangerous.com/)

Besides writing software, I have been trying, for almost 10 years now, to create a video as stunningly beautiful as [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a71bZ1YG68U) that I saw when I started [paragliding](https://github.com/mmomtchev/mmomtchev/blob/master/AERIAL_SPORTS.md). I have come [a long way](https://www.youtube.com/user/momtchev) since I started in [2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzTU611kfrw).

I also used to spent lots of time doing blue water sailing before my affair spiraled out of control.

I am an active member of the French Paragliding and Hang-gliding Federation <https://www.ffvl.fr> and (currently) an inactive member of the French Sailing Federation <https://www.ffvoile.fr>.
