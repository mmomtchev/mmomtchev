# La French Tech

***Or how did we end up here - with half of the French IT sector being implicated in a extortion over a penis-size problem***

## The French Cultural Exception

In order to understand the Penisgate affair, one has to understand France first.

Some things, and sex in particular, simply do not work like people from other countries would expect in France.

You see, when a US president got a blowjob in the Oval Office, lots of people expected him to unconditionally resign.

In France, it simply doesn't work this way.

The previous French president was probably the first ever head of state to officially sport two First Girlfriends. Their antics made him appear as often in the tabloid media as in the politics section.

The one before him divorced and then married an ex-top-model-turned-singer. During his term.

The current one married his high-school teacher.

In most other countries a sex scandal would usually involve an older man in a position of power or wealth and a younger woman profiting from him. In France, we had a huge scandal over a very wealthy and very old lady who was being taking advantage of by a younger companion - who was receiving indecent amounts of gifts.

Over here, they call this *"The French Cultural Exception"*. It is a very important principle, firmly embedded in the French society and codified in the French Constitution.

## The French IT Sector

In France, one will often hear the following statement:

***French engineers and French higher education are among the best in the world, yet there are very few French high-tech business success stories***

Many French do not know it - but it was something that also was deeply believed by most Eastern European countries in the early years after the Soviet era. As time progressed, the quality of the higher education gradually went down, while the average business acumen went up, so these days people in Eastern Europe tend to have a much more correct understanding of the world economy.

Not so in France where things have been quiet for 6 decades and no one has had to readjust his views.

Many years ago I used to work in a French high-tech startup that was a very rare breed - it was both an early comer and a world-level leader in its emerging field. It had a very good team who had delivered an excellent product all with a relatively modest, for this sector, initial investment. Yes, a small French startup was very successful in selling an IT product aboard. Then as the time passed, its emerging field became a significant world market and the first serious US competitors started to appear. Companies that popped out of nowhere were catching up with us and they were doing so at an astounding rate.

It was still a small company where everyone knew everyone - and once our CEO told us -

*You see, doing IT business in France is difficult. We did our best with the investment banks and we were barely able to raise 15Mâ‚¬ on our latest round of funding. Our competitor in the US got $500M on their first round. Their R&D department has 10 times the number of engineers we do. We are doomed.* 

(They are still in business 20 years later)

It is a mindset that is all too common among French IT executives. You see - an European company cannot sell in the US. We don't have access to the same funding. **There is *bias* against us.**

So what is the problem? Do the Californian investment funds have a problem with the French accent? Well, probably some of them find it funny in private, but generally speaking, in the investment funds nothing is funny.

Look at the Asians. Aren't they selling IT in the US? Look at Airbus. They achieved what almost everyone believed to be impossible. Why not the IT then?

### The Nepotism

*Nepotism* is the curse of every society. It is a very deep problem that is impossible to eradicate - unlike its cousin, *corruption*, which can be solved by force (legal/justice). Most people think that the Soviet system failed because of its inherent economical ineffectiveness or its unsustainable military spending. While these factors certainly played a role, what really killed the Soviet system was nepotism. Nowhere nepotism is so bad as in an authoritarian government - especially one that is in control of all aspects of society - politics, economy and even religion. This is why these countries in fact regressed. Their first generation of communist leaders were ruthless fighters who had achieved power by force. Their second generation, where there was a second generation at all - because most of them, completely unable to change the ruling generation, transformed into gerontocracies - were spoiled brats born in power.

What is the natural counter for nepotism?

It is competition of course. And **investors skipping your company**.

Now, nepotism isn't that bad in France. It actually takes a Penisgate affair - or your competitor raising 10 times more money than you - to realize it. But it is still there, undermining the economy every day. In France, they even have a word for it - they call it **"copinage"**. It is a system that is very similar to a political machine - which is the way politics work in many Western democracies. But in France, it is also found in many large companies - which is rather extraordinary.

As markets become increasing global, this is something that probably will resolve by itself.

### Don't Rock The Boat

The IT sector is very different from auto, cosmetics, chemistry, nuclear power or aerospace - sectors dominated by huge international consortiums and where the French are world leaders. This problem is not specific to France - the situation is more or less the same everywhere in the European Union. There hasn't been a successful IT company in the EU since SAP in the 1980s. Nokia, the pearl of the European IT sector went from a quasi-monopoly to bust in less than 2 years after facing what was the number one most competitive company in the world at that time.

So, if we can make cars and airplanes, what is our problem making computers and software? How comes the Asians are able to beat us by such a large margin? After all, the EU is famous for its social welfare, high living standards and extreme political stability - factors that should be ideal for R&D-heavy industries.

Well, IT requires more than that.

When an auto maker wins against another auto maker, it is a protracted battle over slim margins, quality control, production efficiency and costs. The typical executive will stay in its company for decades, slowly acquiring experience and moving through the ladder. He will rarely be a risk-taker. The ones that will be successful are the ones that will excel at balancing statism with innovation. In such a company **"copinage** wouldn't be so detrimental to its efficiency.

On the other hand, when an IT company wins against another one, it is usually an explosive face-off where the leader is decided very fast and the loser is driven out of business. Typically, such company would be led by a highly aggressive outsider with unorthodox thinking and behavior, and usually troubled childhood and/or emotional instability. There are two reasons that make this market so volatile: a) it is young and innovation is still very intense and b) it is famous for its low entry costs and low production costs - basically manufacturing a product becomes free once it is researched and developed.

The one thing that the US and the Asian economies have in common, and that we lack in Europe, is exactly that ruthless, cut-throat, winner-takes-it-all approach to doing business that drives innovation in the IT market.

The dont-rock-the-boat mentality is another factor that made the Penisgate affair possible. In a company where the bottom-line is king, it wouldn't have been possible.

### The Extreme Leniency of the French Judicial System on White-Collar Crime

Organized white-collar crime is relatively rare in France. Not only Amazon or Facebook will never happen in France - Enron, Turing Pharmaceuticals or Theranos won't happen either. Such thirst for power and wealth remains relatively rare. As white-collar crime, particularly organized crime, remains rare, the judicial system tend to be extremely lenient in those cases. For as long as there is no public outrage, no one will do anything. The Penisgate affair proves that it is absolutely conceivable that numerous judges and other judicial officials could in fact even help someone with an obvious extortion scheme - for as long as they are convinced that the affair won't see the light of the day.

It is a problem that is somewhat specific to France. Even if all forms of organized crime remain relatively rare - especially compared to neighboring Italy - for example France is the only country in the EU with a serious recurring problem of drug running by police officers. Once again - when things get really out of hand and it becomes impossible to continue to cover it up - the perpetrators are quietly punished but both the Ministry of the Interior and the judicial systems are capable of going to extreme lengths to avoid any unnecessary publicity of those cases.

France is also the country where one of the most remarkable legal affairs of the last few decades happened - the Outreau Affair - a hugely publicized trial of a "pedophile ring", that made the headlines for months at a time, and that turned out to have been largely invented by a very ambitious prosecutor and a mentally disturbed witness. Seven persons, which were subsequently completely cleared of any wrongdoing, were detained for 3 years with one of them dying while in custody from a medication overdose. His death was never investigated, but his family was able to win its case against France in the European Court of Human Rights.

Yet, that same prosecutor, famous for having said:

*"The judicial system should never recognize its errors too easily as this could undermine its reputation"*

is today a high-ranking judge in the Court of Cassation - France's court of last resort. He never did any prison term, nor he was even on trial. All he got was a reprimand.

That mentality, all too common throughout law enforcement in France, of *"keeping it under wraps"* is another very important factor.
